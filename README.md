# Code-Samples
This repository contains coding samples from a variety of projects throughout my MSc studies at the univeristy of Amsterdam.

## Scipy Model Fitting
Fitting models on synthetic dark matter detection data, first for instrumental calibration purposes and then for parameter constraints.
Calculation of maximum likelihood estimates and resulting errors using different methods, chi-squared estimation and visualization.
Self-contained in a jupyter-notebook along with explanations taken at each step. Data are provided in the file.

## Scipy Statistical Tests
Data filtering and correlation checking using pearson's r for a sample of galaxies, based on their physical properties. 
Linear regression to quantify correlations, student's t-tests for checking statistical integrity.
Bootsrapping for reconstructing the distributions of parameters of interest for further statistical tests.
Provided in the for of a jupyter-notebook with the associated data included in the file.
